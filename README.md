### 👋 Hey, I'm Prasad — an immersive systems developer

I'm a master's student in Mechatronics and Cyber-Physical Systems, passionate about blending **robotics and VR** to build human-centered tech.

🔧 I work on:
- 🔄 Autonomous robots using **ROS, Python, SLAM, and LiDAR**
- 🕶️ Industrial training simulations in **Unity and C#**
- 🧠 Machine learning projects with **scikit-learn & pandas**

🎯 My focus: building **simulations and control systems** that make robotics safer, smarter, and more intuitive for humans.

🛠️ Currently learning:
- 🌐 ROS2 and C++
- 🧪 Real-world applications of immersive robotics

📌 Projects:
- 🔸 [Inventory Bot (ROS, SLAM)]
- 🔸 [VR Safety Training Simulation]
- 🔸 [Path Planning Research]
- 🔸 [ML with Kaggle – Titanic Challenge]

Let’s build tech that feels human.
